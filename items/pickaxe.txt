*You have found: A Pickaxe
*ATT: +3
*AG: -1
*It's a well-used pickaxe. The iron head is scratched and dented in places and the wooden handle is fraying slightly at the ends, but it seems sturdy enough. You doubt it'd survive a few good swings at solid rock, but perhaps you could find another purpose for it.
