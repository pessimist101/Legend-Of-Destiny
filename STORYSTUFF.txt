*You find yourself standing before a mighty stone cliff some hundred feet tall in which a mine has been dug out. Looking down, you see the entrance: An unnaturally square hole in the rock blackened with outreaching soot and held up by mossy and rotten support beams that leads into a humid and pitch-coloured corridor.
*You inhale deeply. You look at your surroundings one last time, contemplating the route through the evergreens you took on your way here. It was so beautiful.

*...

*You enter the mine.


*It's dark. A few steps in and already it is difficult to see the daylight behind you. This darkness is like nothing you have experienced before -- It is almost tangible.


*...*


*You can no longer see the daylight behind you. You strike a match and light your guiding lantern, compelling the shadows with a warm and flickering glow.
*Ahead of you lies a wall of darkness, similar to the one you experienced when entering the mine.
*Behind you, there is nothing but stone.

*You are trapped. The only move is forwards. Something or someone has clearly engineered this situation which you do not want to be in, but you have no choice. At some point, if you are still alive, your paths will likely cross.
*You must play their game.
