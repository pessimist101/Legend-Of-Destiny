*You find yourself standing before a mighty stone cliff some hundred feet tall in which a mine has been dug out. Looking down, you see the entrance: An unnaturally square hole in the rock blackened with outreaching soot and held up by mossy and rotten support beams that leads into a humid and pitch-coloured corridor.
*You inhale deeply. You look at your surroundings one last time, contemplating the route through the evergreens you took on your way here. It was so beautiful.
*You enter the mine.
